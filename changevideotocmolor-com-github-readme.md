# How I Restored My 1990s Childhood Videos: Turn Black and White to Color with AI

Last month, I was going through boxes in my parents' garage and found a stack of old MiniDV tapes from the late 1990s. You know the ones - those small cassette tapes that everyone recorded family moments on before smartphones existed. I borrowed a friend's camcorder, digitized everything, and realized most of the footage was in black and white.

I wanted to share these memories with my siblings, but let's be honest - grainy, monochrome video isn't exactly compelling to watch. That's when I went down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to [make video color](https://changevideotocolor.com/) again.

## The Problem with Most Solutions

I tried a bunch of free apps first. Big mistake. They either:
- Just slapped a sepia filter over everything (not real colorization)
- Took forever to process and crashed my laptop
- Had monthly subscriptions for something I only needed to do once
- Produced this weird flickering effect where colors jumped around frame by frame

I even looked into professional software like DaVinci Resolve, but that costs hundreds of dollars and requires a serious gaming PC to render anything. For a few home videos? No thanks.

## What Actually Worked

Eventually I stumbled across this tool that lets you [black and white videos to color](https://changevideotocolor.com/) using their cloud AI. The whole experience was completely different from what I'd tried before.

### The Process Was Surprisingly Simple

I uploaded one of my digitized files (they accept all the weird formats - MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM, even old VOB files), and their AI analyzed the video frame by frame. It identifies objects in the scene - sky, grass, skin tones, clothing - and reconstructs what the original colors probably were.

What I liked is that you can [add color to video](https://changevideotocolor.com/) and see a free preview snippet before paying anything. I could test a few different clips to make sure the quality was decent before committing.

### Why This Approach Makes Sense

The big difference is that everything happens in the cloud on their servers. When you [turn video to color](https://changevideotocolor.com/), you're not melting your laptop's processor trying to render AI video effects. They use industrial GPUs that handle the processing way faster than a regular computer ever could.

They also figured out the flickering problem. Cheap tools colorize each frame independently, so a tree might be green in one frame and brown in the next. This service uses something called "temporal consistency" - if an object is blue in frame one, it stays blue in frame one hundred. The AI understands context and maintains it throughout the footage.

## Real-World Results

I processed about two hours of footage total. Some of it was birthday parties, school plays, random backyard stuff. The AI did a surprisingly good job of figuring out realistic colors - grass looked green, skies looked blue, skin tones looked natural.

For my [old video to color](https://changevideotocolor.com/) conversion, I even tried their premium option that upscales to 4K. The difference on a modern TV is pretty wild - those fuzzy 480p tapes actually look sharp when blown up.

## Pricing Model Makes Sense for Occasional Use

What I appreciated is the pricing structure. Most services want you to sign up for a monthly subscription, but who needs to [ai colorize video](https://changevideotocolor.com/) every single month? This place lets you either:
- Buy credits once and use them whenever
- Pay per video individually
- No recurring charges

That's perfect for a one-time project like digitizing old family tapes.

## It Handles Different Types of Footage

I had mostly camcorder tapes, but I tested it on some other stuff too:
- Old VHS transfers
- A clip from a 1950s documentary I found online
- Some phone video that somehow got desaturated

The tool is designed to [black and white to color video](https://changevideotocolor.com/) convert all kinds of source material. It even works on historical footage if you're trying to [color old movies](https://changevideotocolor.com/) or archive family history.

## Better Than General Video Editing Tools

I initially tried doing this in CapCut and Canva since I already use those for other projects. But those apps are designed for general editing - their color features are basically just filters. They don't actually reconstruct colors, they just tint the footage.

To [ai black and white to color video](https://changevideotocolor.com/) properly, you need specialized AI that's trained on millions of color images and understands what objects are supposed to look like. That's completely different from slapping a warm filter over black and white footage.

## Privacy Consideration

One thing I checked before uploading family videos: they auto-delete everything from their servers after 24 hours. So your memories aren't sitting around on someone else's cloud storage indefinitely. Everything is processed and then wiped.

## Worth It for the Right Use Case

Look, this isn't something most people need every day. But if you've got a box of old tapes sitting around, or you're helping parents digitize their wedding video, or you found some historical footage you want to restore - it's pretty cool seeing those moments come back in color.

The whole process took me maybe an hour total to convert everything. Now I've got these restored videos backed up and shared with my family, and honestly, it's way more compelling to watch than the grainy black and white versions.

If you're sitting on old home video footage and want to see it properly restored, I'd at least try the free preview to see what the AI can do with your specific material.
